## App: Xavier Omär Personal Site Redesign

app link:

## App Description:

This app serves as the personal brand website for an artist. In this case that artist is the R&B/Soul singer Xavier Omär - he's great, so you should definitely checkout his music. It provides access to his album discography, latest music videos, merch, and the ability to sign up to join his team's mailing list.

## Motivation

I created this website based on my love for music. I think it's important for artists to have control over their art and be able to engage their fans on their own terms. I decided to move forward with designing an artist web page that would serve as a way to connect with true fans who support their music.

## Features

The App landing page provides the option to login as an User/Guest or to sign up on the App. Movie Scoop give you an abundance of movies to see the details, ratings, and reviews.
